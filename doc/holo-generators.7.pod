=head1 NAME

holo-generators - dynamically generate resource files for other plugins

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generators are executable files placed under F</usr/share/holo/generators>.
Holo will execute generators B<in lexical order> before asking plugins to scan
their resource files. An output directory will be supplied to each generator in
the environment variable C<$OUT>. Except for caching purposes (see below),
generators shall only write to F<$OUT/>.

The structure under F<$OUT/> is the same as for static resource files under
F</usr/share/holo/>. For example, to generate resource files for
L<holo-files(8)>, a generator may place files at F<$OUT/files/>.

Generated files placed under F<$OUT/> and static files under F</usr/share/holo/>
will be made available to plugins, with generated files taking precedence over
static files. For instance, if a generator places a file at
F<$OUT/files/20-webserver/etc/nginx/nginx.conf>, the L<holo-files(8)> plugin
will see this file in its C<$HOLO_RESOURCE_DIR> instead of
F</usr/share/holo/files/20-webserver/etc/nginx/nginx.conf>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

Besides C<$OUT>, generators are provided with the following environment variables.

=over 4

=item C<$HOLO_RESOURCE_ROOT> (default: F<$HOLO_ROOT_DIR/usr/share/holo>)

Where all static resource files are located. Static resource files for a
specific plugin are in F<$HOLO_RESOURCE_ROOT/$PLUGIN_ID/>.

=item C<$HOLO_CACHE_DIR> (default: below C<${TMPDIR:-/tmp}>)

Where the generator may store temporary data. Holo will create this directory
for the generator, and clean it up after the generator has exited.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<holo(8)> provides the user interface for this functionality.
