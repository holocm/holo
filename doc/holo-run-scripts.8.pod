=head1 NAME

holo-run-scripts - Holo plugin to run custom provisioning scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin can be used to run custom provisioning scripts during C<holo apply>.
Scripts must be intalled into the directory F</usr/share/holo/run-scripts> and
must be executable. Instead of a script, a binary, or a symlink to a script or
binary, can also be installed. Scripts will be executed in alphabetical order.

The entity name for a script is C<script:$name>, where C<$name> is the basename
of the file.

=head2 Diff

Holo cannot compute a meaningful diff for the effect of an arbitrary script, so
C<holo diff script:$name> will not produce any output.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<holo(8)> provides the user interface for using this plugin.
