=head1 NAME

holo-ssh-keys - Holo plugin to provision C<.ssh/authorized_keys>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin provisions SSH keys into the C<$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys> of a
user. Key files are found at F</usr/share/holo/ssh-keys/$user/$ident.pub>,
where C<$user> is the name of the user whose C<authorized_keys> will be edited.
Each key file is an entity within Holo, with the entity name
C<ssh-keyset:$user/$ident>. For example:

    $ holo scan ssh-keyset:john-doe/login

    ssh-keyset:john-doe/login
        found in /usr/share/holo/ssh-keys/john-doe/login.pub
          key is 2048 SHA256:vogJG+8rxIB80hEp8OCJLUQgtfOajXHudPp6YvDvY8W john@example.org (RSA)

The last information line contains the output of C<ssh-keygen -l>. If the file
contains multiple public keys, there will appear one such line per key.

The format of SSH public key files is documented in L<sshd(8)> in the section
I<authorized_keys file format>.

=head2 Apply operation

When a key file is applied, all keys in it will be added to
C<.ssh/authorized_keys> (unless already present). To track which keys were
provisioned by Holo, the comment field of the key is replaced by
C<holo=$entity_name>.

Applying a key file entity will also remove all keys from
C<.ssh/authorized_keys> which are tagged with this entity name, but are not
present in the resource file for this entity. Keys can thus be replaced in or
removed from the key file, and all changes will be propagated into
C<.ssh/authorized_keys> automatically (without requiring C<--force>).
